# Simulation study


## Simulation summary

In this set of simulations, we consider 600 simulated regions each with 39 overlapping genes. The genotype data are obtained from the GTEx project and cover a ~13Mb region from chromosome 3. Due to the NIH policy regarding privacy of genetic data, we are not allowed to distribute real genotype data from the GTEx project. See the manuscript Methods for details on how gene expression and complex traits were simulated.  

## Required R packages

qvalue (1.5.0), ggplot2 (3.4.2), INTACT (1.0.2), dplyr (1.1.3), tidyr (1.3.0), data.table (1.14.8)

## Running analysis

Run ```make``` to start the analysis process.
