# METSIM plasma metabolite data analysis


## Analysis details

In this analysis, we integrate the UK Biobank plasma pQTL data (Sun et al. (2023)) to  implicate putative causal genes and mechanisms underlying plasma metabolite levels. We cannot distribute the individual-level genotype and phenotype data from the METSIM study due to privacy policy. See the manuscript Methods for details on the analysis.


## Required R packages


data.table (1.14.8), ggplot2 (3.4.2), tidyr (1.3.0),dplyr (1.1.3),stringr (1.5.0),eulerr (7.0.0)
